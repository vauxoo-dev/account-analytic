  I check that Initially customer invoice state is "Draft"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_analytics}:
    - state == 'draft'
-
  I called the "Confirm Draft Invoices" wizard
-
  !record {model: account.invoice.confirm, id: account_invoice_confirm_0}:
    {}

  !python {model: account.invoice.confirm}: |
    self.invoice_confirm(cr, uid, [ref("account_invoice_confirm_0")], {"lang": 'en_US',
      "tz": False, "active_model": "account.invoice", "active_ids": [ref("account_invoice_analytics")],
      "active_id": ref("account_invoice_analytics"), })
